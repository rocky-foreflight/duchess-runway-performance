# Model 76, Beechcraft Duchess Runway Model

This repository contains work to implement a runway model for the Beechcraft Duchess. I'm working on this as a research project with advisement from the Aircraft Data team.

## Why?

1) I'm doing my multi-engine training in a Beechcraft Duchess, and because we don't have a runway model, I have to use paper charts.
2) I've done similar performance work before joining ForeFlight. I want to learn more about how we handle performance in our app.
