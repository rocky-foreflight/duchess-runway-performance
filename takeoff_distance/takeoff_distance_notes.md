## Notes

I messed up one point in Headwind Model graph:
  - `10.42,2151.64` is part of wrong curve in the WebPlotDigitizer `takeoff_distance.json` file.
  - I corrected this in the Excel spreadsheet.

No other anomalies to report.

## TODO

- Add "funnels" around T/O distance data.
- See: `03_CreatingFunnel.mov`.
